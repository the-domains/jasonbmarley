  As a founder and chief technology officer of a U.S. commercial spaceflight
  company, I'm proud to live in a country that openly supports and encourages
  innovation through action. In that regard, the Federal Aviation Administration
  has been a key collaborator, supporter and enabler of the commercial human
  spaceflight industry.
